   <h2> MK Ultra Support Group-MSG 1</h2>
   <p> A punk album from recent times focusing on the internet. This is a complitation of a bunch of different artist, and while the album is supposed to be ironic, I do still like the music. </p>

   <h2> Minor Threat- Self titled </h2>
   <p> This is by far my favororite album of all time, it has all of the things that make punk what it is today, with the rawness of it being a straight edge band.</p>
